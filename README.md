Understanding the Planetary Formation and Evolution in Star Clusters

Please cite the following paper if you use our catalog. 

The meanings of each column.

Plname:     the name of planets/candidates

Rp:         the planet radius, in the unit of Earth radii

OName:      the name of parental star clusters (Here, some of new  clusters/cluster candidates do not have names)

Group:      the Group number, the same as Kounkel et al. 2020 (Here, some of are not cross-matched. Thus, without Group number)

Gaia DR2:   the source id in Gaia DR2

Age:        the age of the host star

Validation: Three types, i.e. "Yes" means that the age is validated, "NO" means that the age is not validated, and "Excluded" means that the age is not convincing. 

Teff:       the effective temperature of the host star, in the unit of K

logg:       the surface gravity of the host star

Stmass:     the mass of the host star, in the unit of solar-mass

Flag:       Planets detected by different missions are flagged as ``Kepler'', ``K2'', ``TESS'', and ``other''. Here, ``other'' means sources detected by other facilities, e.g. CoRoT \citep{2009A&A...506..287L} and ground-based telescopes.
